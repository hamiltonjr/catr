# CatR
A naive version of Unix-like cat command.

This version is based to an exercise made reading the book:
   
   Command-line Rust - a project-based primer for writing Rust CLI
   Author: Ken Youens-Clark   Edited by O'Reilly.

The cat command has other arguments and I intend implement all this arguments functionalities.
